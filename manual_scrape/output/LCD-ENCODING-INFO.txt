LG MICROWAVE LCD CHARACTER ENCODING
====================================

The LG microwave uses special characters on its LCD display to represent certain numbers.

LCD CHARACTER MAPPING:
----------------------
LCD Char → Actual Number/Letter
   O     →      0
   Q     →      0
   z     →      2
   s     →      5
   G     →      9
   η     →      Gh (Greek eta displayed as Gh on seven-segment)

EXAMPLES:
---------
Original LCD Code → Decoded Code → Recipe Name
Coz1             → Co21           → Veg Manchurian
HP1O             → HP10           → Spinach Dal
HPG              → HP9            → Soyabean Curry
CCz              → CC2            → Lemon Pickle
HPs              → HP5            → Soya Idli
ηh1              → Gh1            → Ghee
sA1              → 5A1            → Rice Salad
so3              → 5o3            → Wonton Soup

DECODING STATISTICS:
--------------------
Total recipes: 204
Codes decoded: 130 (63.7%)
Remaining unchanged: 74 (36.3%)

AFFECTED CATEGORIES:
--------------------
All categories had some codes that needed decoding, particularly:
- Health Plus (HP)
- Continental (Co)
- Child's Favourite (CF)
- Soup (5o - note the 5 instead of s)
- Salad (5A - note the 5 instead of s)
- Steam Cook (5t/5C)
- Sweet Corner (5C)
- Indian Cuisine (IC)
- Rice Delight (rd)
- Chatpat Corner (CC)
- Tea/Dairy Delight (dd)
- Paneer/Curd (PA/CU)
- Cooking Aid (UC)
- Tandoor Se (t5)

WHY THIS ENCODING?
------------------
The LG microwave LCD display has limited character support, so it uses
similar-looking letters to represent numbers:
- 'O' looks like zero (0)
- 'z' looks like 2 on LCD displays
- 's' looks like 5 on LCD displays
- 'G' looks like 9 on LCD displays

WEBAPP UPDATE:
--------------
All menu codes in the webapp have been automatically decoded to show the
actual numeric values (Co21 instead of Coz1) for better readability.

Original data: manual_scrape/output/vegetarian-recipes.json
Decoded data: manual_scrape/output/vegetarian-recipes-decoded.json
Webapp uses: webapp/public/data/recipes.json (decoded version)
